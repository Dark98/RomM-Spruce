# To-Do

## Necessities

- SD is hardcoded based on where RomM client was run (backs out two directories). Regain ability to choose SD2.

## Ideas

- Allow a config file for `platform_maps.py` or compose maps from `es_systems.xml` file if present.
- Allow a config file for users to change the color and text of the UI buttons to customize to their device.
